takeoff
=======

takeoff is a Python implementation of the despegar.com API. despegar.com is a 
hotel and flight booking site, which has a huge database and is one of the
most popular travelling sites in South America.

This project is based primarily on the dev's needs regarding what to obtain
from the API. As such, we welcome any contributors who wish to map parts of the
API and/or add any convenience functions (although we do ask to keep those as
generic as possible, so they can be of use to most people).
