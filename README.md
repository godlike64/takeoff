takeoff
=======

takeoff is a Python implementation of the despegar.com API. despegar.com is a 
travelling (hotels, cars,flights) booking site, which has a huge database and is
one of the most popular sites of its kind in South America.

This project is based primarily on the dev's needs regarding what to obtain
from the API. As such, we welcome any contributors who wish to map parts of the
API and/or add any convenience functions (although we do ask to keep those as
generic as possible, so they can be of use to most people).

Please note that you may need an API key in order to use Despegar's API. We do
not provide one, so we must unfortunately leave it to you to request one. Should we
granted one for limited, public use, we'll be happy to bundle it here.
